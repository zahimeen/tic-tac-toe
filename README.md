# About

A project like this came about into my head while I was learning JavaScript. I thought, *why not make something fun that I could also use to show off to my friends*. That is when I also found out there aren't that many decent looking games of Tic Tac Toe on the web or any mobile store. And the ones that do exist requires in-game payments, have a lot of adds, or steal your data.

**That is when I knew that I must make the greatest game of Tic Tac Toe one could ever find.**
